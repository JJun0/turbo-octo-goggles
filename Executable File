# Default mode is "auto", "auto" is for auto nightshift
# (19:00 ` 07:00), "manual" is for manual toggle, and
# "on/off" is for default on /off.

# Whatever the user's chocie is, it will supersede the
# default setting of the site and be kept during the
# visit (session). Only the dark mode setting is "manual",
# it will be always kept on every visit (i.e. no matter
# the broswer is closed or not)
